# This is a dummy Android app that uses Google Vision Product Search API to search for products that match to an image taken/uploaded from the adroid device.

**I am not an Android developer and this app is full of bugs, lacks tests, contains pieces of code that are not optimal. So, please don't use this as a model!!**
